## One-sided tokens
* Spawn a `Token` item (`Objects > Components > Custom > Token`)
* If you want the miniature to count how many tokens of the same kind have been applied to it, check the `Stackable` option
* Add the url of the token's `Image` and click on `Import`
* Right click on the newly created token then access the `Tags` menu voice and add a new tag called `KTUITokenSimple` or highlight it from the list if already present
* Right click on the token add give it a unique description that doesn't contain any spaces or new lines and nothing else. Please refer to [Reserved names](#reserved-names) to check a list of already reserved names
* You can also give it a fancy name but it's not mandatory
